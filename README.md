# Prescriptive DGA Detector

A practical end-to-end tool that classifies a domain as either **Legitimate** or **Generated by a DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)**.  
In addition to detection, it provides explanations of *why* the decision was made and outlines a response plan that can be followed in an incident-handling scenario.

## Goals

1. **Fast Model Training** – Use of automated machine learning to quickly build an effective classifier.  
2. **Transparency** – Provide interpretable explanations of why a domain was flagged.  
3. **Actionability** – Deliver a structured response plan that security teams can operationalize.

## How It Works

### Training (`1_train_and_export.py`)
- Extracts lightweight features from domains (e.g., `length`, `entropy`).  
- Trains a detection model using **H2O AutoML**.  
- Exports the best-performing model as a compressed archive (`model/DGA_Leader.zip`).  
- Stores reference files such as:
  - `feature_schema.json` – defines input features.  
  - `background_stats.json` – captures baseline statistics used for explainability.

### Analyzer (`2_analyze_domain.py`)
- Run with:
  ```cmd
  python 2_analyze_domain.py --domain exampledomain.tld
